Logic and math puzzles I've accumulated over time. I didn't create these - many
of them are classics which are widely known.
Each puzzle has a worked solution.

There are currently {{ site.puzzles | size }} puzzles in the collection.
Choose a puzzle from the list or view
[all puzzles]({{ '/all' | relative_url }}) on one page.

Report any problems with the puzzles in the
[github repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues).
