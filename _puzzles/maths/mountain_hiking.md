At 6 am you start hiking on a path up a mountain. You walk at a variable pace,
resting occasionally. At 6 pm that day you reach the top of the mountain. You
camp out overnight.

The next morning you wake up at 6 am and start your descent down the
mountain. Again you walk down the path at a variable pace, resting
occasionally. The downhill hike is easier, but you are tired after yesterday and
at 6 pm you reach the bottom.

Is it possible to find some time during the second day, such that you are at the
exact same spot you were on at the same time on the first day?

You can always find a spot such that you were there at the same time on both the
first and the second day.

### Proof

Imagine a second hiker, who starts climbing the same path at 6 am on the second
day. Now assume that the second hiker walks at exactly the same speed you did on
the first, and takes the same breaks you did.

Now on the second day, since you both start at opposite ends of the path at 6
am and finish at opposite ends at 6 pm, you must have met each other along the
way. The point where you meet gives a point where you were at the same position
at a given time on both days.
