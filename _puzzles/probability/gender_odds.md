In these questions assume that the boys and girls are equally likely to be born.

In a two-child family, one child is a boy. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?

<details><summary></summary>

The probability is $$ \frac{2}{3} $$

### Proof

There are 4 possible two-child families:

1. Boy Boy
2. Boy Girl
3. Girl Boy
4. Girl Girl

(4) is not possible, since we know that the family has a boy.
There are 3 possibilities and in 2 of the the other child is a
girl.

This gives a probability of $$ \frac{2}{3} $$.

The unintuitive result is because the probability of a family having both a boy and a girl is twice as likely as having
2 boys (or 2 girls).

In a two-child family, the older child is a boy. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?

<details><summary></summary>

The probability is $$ \frac{1}{2} $$

### Proof

List the 4 possible two-child families. The older child is listed
first, then the younger.

1. Boy Boy
2. Boy Girl
3. Girl Boy
4. Girl Girl

This time only (1) and (2) are possible since we know that the
_older child_ is a boy. In only 1 of these 2 possibilities is the
other child a girl.

This gives a probability of $$ \frac{1}{2} $$.
