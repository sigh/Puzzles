Mary baked a rectangular cake. John secretly carved out a small rectangular
piece, ate it and got away. The remaining cake has to be split evenly between
Mary's two kids. The cake is layered, and the kids want to be sure they both get
the same amount of each layer.

How could this be done with only one cut through the cake?

Make a vertical cut that goes through the midpoints of the original cake, and
the midpoint of the missing section.

### Proof

Cutting a rectangle through its midpoint will always divide it in half. Thus
each half in our divided cake will have half of the original cake with half of
the missing section.

This makes the size of each slice exactly equal.
