Show that if each point in the plane is colored with 3 different colors, a unit
segment must exist whose endpoints are the same color.

{% solution %}

Set up two equilateral triangles ABC and BCD with unit sides which share a side.
Let the color of A be green.

If B or C are green then we are done. Likewise if D is the same color as B or C.

This leaves the case where D is green. Since the triangle can be
oriented in any direction, all points the same distance from A as D
is colored green. This describes a green circle.

The circles has a larger than unit diameter, and thus there are
an infinite number of points on the circle which are a unit distance
from each other.
