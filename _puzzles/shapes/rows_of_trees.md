![Rows of trees solution]({{'images/rows_of_trees.png' | relative_url}})

To construct:

* Start with a middle row of 3 equally spaced trees.
* Place a center tree in the top row at _any_ distance from the center.
* Place a center tree in the bottom row at the _same_ distance from the center
  as the top.
* The positions of the remaining trees are forced by extending the top
  and bottom rows parallel with the center row.
