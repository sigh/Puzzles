Four ghost ships - $$A$$, $$B$$, $$C$$ and $$D$$ - sail on a night so foggy that
visibility is nearly zero. All ships sail in a straight line, changing neither
speed or heading. They have been sailing this way for a long time, and all
have different headings.

Sometime in the night $$A$$ collides with $$B$$, but they pass through each
other since they are ghost ships. However as they pass $$A$$'s captain hear
$$B$$'s exclaim that it was their third collision that night.

Later in the night $$A$$ run into $$C$$ and hears the same exclamation from
$$C$$'s captain.

Will $$A$$ hit $$D$$?

<details><summary></summary>

$$A$$ will definetly hit $$D$$.

### Proof

Plot the path of the ships in 3 dimensions, with time as the third
dimension.

The paths of ships $$B$$ and $$C$$ form a plane
(since they are different headings).

The path of $$A$$ is on the same plane since it intersects with both $$B$$ and
$$C$$. Likewise for $$D$$. Hence the paths of $$A$$ and $$D$$ are co-planar.

$$A$$ and $$D$$ are on different headings, hence their paths intersect.
They've both been sailing for a long time, hence their paths don't intersect
in the path, so they must intersect in the future.
