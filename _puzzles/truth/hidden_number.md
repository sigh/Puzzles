I'm thinking of a number: 1, 2, or 3. You may ask me one question,
and I will answer with either "Yes", "No" or "I don't know".

Can you determine my number?

Yes. You need a question which will map each answer to a different number.

Example:

> "I am thinking of an odd number. Is my number divisible by yours?"
>
> * "Yes" $$\rightarrow$$ 1
> * "No" $$\rightarrow$$ 2
> * "I don't know" $$\rightarrow$$ 3

In general, injecting hidden information of your own makes it easier to force
one of the answers to be "I don't know".
