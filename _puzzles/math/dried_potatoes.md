You have a 100 kg bag of potatoes. The potatoes are 99% water. You leave the
potatoes out overnight and they dry out so they only contain 98% water.

How much do the potatoes weigh now?

<details><summary></summary>

50 kg.

### Proof

Being 99% water, the potatoes are originally 99 kg water and 1 kg solid.
When dried, the solid weight remains the same, but is now 2% of the weight.
Thus 1 kg is now 2% $$ = \frac{1}{50}$$th of the weight, giving a total weight
of 50 kg.
