A thin belt is stretched around three pulleys, each of which is 1 m in
diameter. The distances between the centers of the pulleys are 3 m, 4 m,
and 6 m. How long is the belt?

{% solution %}

The belt can be divided into straight and curved sections. The lengths of the
straight sections are the same as the distances between the centers of the
pulleys, and the curved sections total one complete circumference. So the total
length is $$3 + 4 + 6 + \pi \approx 16.1$$ m.
