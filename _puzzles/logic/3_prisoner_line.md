title: 3 prisoners in a line
---

3 prisoners are brought to a room with 3 red hats and 2 blue hats. They are told
to line up single file facing forward, so that each prisoner can only see those
in front of them. They are blindfolded and a hat is placed on each prisoners
head. The remaining hats are disposed of.

The blindfolds are removed and the prisoners are told that the first person to
correctly call out the colour of their hat will go free. They have one minute.

For a while the prisoners stand silent, but just before the minute is over the
prisoner at the front correctly names the colour of their hat.

What was the colour of the hat on the prisoner at the front?

<details><summary></summary>

The prisoner at the front had a red hat.

### Proof

The prisoner at the back can see the colours of the other two prisoners. If the hats
were both blue then the prisoner could deduce that their own colour was red, and they would
instantly say this. Since the prisoner at the back remained quiet we (and the
two prisoners in front) know that least one of the front two prisoners has a red
hat.

The middle prisoner can only see the colour of the front prisoner's hat. If it
was blue then the prisoner could deduce that their own hat colour was red. However, they do
not speak. This means that the colour of the hat on the front prisoner must be
red.
