title: Short and tall
---

Two hundred students are arranged in 10 rows of 20 children. The shortest
student in each column is identified, and the tallest of these is marked $$ A $$. The
tallest student in each row is identified, and the shortest of these is marked
$$ B $$.

If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are different people, who is taller?

$$ B $$ is taller.

### Proof

There are three different cases:

* If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ stand in the same row, then $$ B $$ is taller, since we know
that $$ B $$ is the tallest student in their row.

* If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ stand in the same column, then again $$ B $$ is taller, since
we know that $$ A $$ is the shortest student in their column.

* If $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ share neither a row nor a column, then let $$ C $$ be the
student who's in the same column as $$ A $$ and the same row as $$ B $$. Then
$$ C $$ is shorter than $$ B $$ (who is the tallest in their row) and taller than
$$ A $$ (who is the shortest in their column), so $$ B > C > A $$.

In every case, $$ B $$ is taller than $$ A $$.
