title: Plane on a conveyor belt

A plane is on an infinitely long conveyor belt. The conveyor belt runs backward
at a speed equal to what the plane would be going if the conveyor belt was not
there. The plane is on wheels which are working properly.

Can the plane take off?

<details><summary></summary>

Yes, the plane can take off.

### Proof

The power for the engines come from the turbines, which is acting against the
air. Thus the plane will develop a velocity relative to the air around it. With
enough thrust it will gain enough speed relative to the air to take off.

The conveyor belt only acts on the wheels, making them rotate faster, but does
not impede the motion of the plane.
