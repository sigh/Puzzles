A scale balances a cup of water with a certain weight. Will the balance be
upset if you put your finger in the water?

{% solution %}

Yes.

The water imparts an upward force on your finger as you immerse it, so you
must exert a downward force to overcome it. That force is transferred to the
cup and then to the scale, which sinks.
