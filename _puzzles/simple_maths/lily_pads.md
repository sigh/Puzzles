In the middle of a pond is a single lily pad. Each day the number of lily pads
doubles. After exactly 14 days the lily pads cover the pond completely.

After how many days did the lily pads cover half the pond?

After 13 days the lily pads covered half the pond.

Since the lily pads doubles each day, on the next day the pads will double
to cover the whole pond, as required.
