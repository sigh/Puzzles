A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.

How much does the ball cost?

<details><summary></summary>

The ball costs 5c.

### Proof

Let the cost of the ball in dollars be $$x$$. Then:

$$
\begin{align}
x + (1+x) & = 1.10 \\
2 x + 1 & = 1.10 \\
2 x & = 0.10 \\
x & = 0.05 \\
\end{align}
$$

### Commentry

This is a classic problem because the intuitive answer when hearing the problem
is 10c until you stop and calculate it.
