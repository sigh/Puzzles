You have in front of you a shuffled deck of cards, face down.
You get to choose a card from any position. Which card should you pick to
maximize your chance of selecting the _second_ black ace from the top.

Select the last (52nd) card.

### Proof

Each position has an equal chance of being a black ace (since the deck is well
shuffled). However, for all but the last card, some of the probability is that
it is the _first_ black ace. Thus the last card has the highest probability of
being the second black ace.
